// CAL CENTER
// Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employeers:
// respondent, manager, and director
// An incoming telophone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free.
// If the respondent can't handle the call. he or she must escalate the call to a manager.
// If the manager is not free or not able to handle it. Then the call should be escalated to a director.
// Design the classes and data structures for this problem.
// Implement a method dispatchCall() which assign a call to the first available employee
